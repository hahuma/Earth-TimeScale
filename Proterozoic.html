    <h2>15 Interestings facts</h2>
    <p>
   1_The period of Earth's history that began 2.5 billion years ago and ended 542.0 million years ago is known as the Proterozoic.<br>
   2_which is subdivided into three eras: the Paleoproterozoic (2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago), Mesoproterozoic (1.6 to 1 billion years ago), and Neoproterozoic (1 billion to 542.0 million years ago)<br>
   3_Stable continents first appeared and began to accrete, a long process taking about a billion years.<br>
   4_ Also coming from this time are the first abundant fossils of living organisms, mostly bacteria and archaeans<br>
   5_ With the beginning of the Mesoproterozoic comes the first evidence of oxygen build-up in the atmosphere. <br>
   6_ The first traces of life appear nearly 3.5 billion years ago, in the early Archean.<br>
   7_ Stromatolite diversity increased through most of the Proterozoic<br>
   8_ This span of time makes up roughly seven-eighths of the Earth's history.<br>
   9_ During the Precambrian, the most important events in biological history took place<br>
   10_ The first "pollution crisis" hit the Earth about 2.2 billion years ago. the presence of iron oxides in paleosols (fossil soils), the appearance of "red beds" containing metal oxides, and others<br>
   11_ Several pieces of evidence point to a fairly rapid increase in levels of oxygen in the atmosphere at about this time<br>
   12_ Early plate tectonics.<br>
   13_ Clean (unchanged by metamorphosis) sand and carbonate deposits occur for the first time.<br>
   14_ Several glaciations, including the Snowball Earth during the Cryogenian period in the late Neoproterozoic.<br>
   15_ First eukaryote fossil at 2.1 billion years.<br>
