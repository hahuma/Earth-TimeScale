    <h1>Archean Eon</h1>
    <h2>15 Interestings facts</h2>
    <p>
   1_ The Archean Eon began about 4 billion years ago with the formation of Earth’s crust and extended to the start of the Proterozoic Eon 2.5 billion years ago<br>
   2_ Records of Earth’s primitive atmosphere and oceans emerge in the earliest Archean (Eoarchean Era)<br>
   3_ Fossil evidence of the earliest primitive life-forms—prokaryotic microbes from the domain called Archaea and bacteria—appears in rocks about 3.5–3.7 billion years old<br>
   4_ The start of the Archean Eon is only defined by the isotopic age of the earliest rocks. <br>
   5_ The earliest terrestrial materials are not rocks but minerals.<br>
   6_ It is thought that the oxygen content in today’s atmosphere must have slowly accumulated through time starting with an atmosphere that was anoxic during Archean times. <br>
   7_ Although oxygen did not accumulate in any appreciable amount in the atmosphere until early Proterozoic time<br>
   8_ the intense volcanism during the Archean Eon caused CO2 to be highly concentrated in the atmosphere.<br>
   9_ Throughout the Archean, oceanic and island arc crust was produced semi-continuously for 1.5 billion years; thus, most Archean rocks are igneous.<br>
   10_ Eventually, the ozone layer forms.<br>
   11_ As oxygen filled the oceans, it mixed with iron. Iron rusts when it reacts with oxygen.<br>
   12_ One type of bacteria present then were the cyanobacteria or blue-green algaes. <br>
   13_ The earliest life forms were anaerobic, forms that did not use oxygen to exist<br>
   14_ Three billion years ago, the sun was only about 70 percent as bright as it is today.<br>
   15_ By the end of the Archaean c. 2500 Ma (million years ago), plate tectonic activity may have been similar to that of the modern Earth.<br>
