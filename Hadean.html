    <h1>Hadean Eon</h1>
    <h2>15 Interestings facts</h2>
    <p>
   1_ Hadean Eon, informal division of Precambrian time occurring between about 4.6 billion and about 4.0 billion years ago. <br>
   2_ The Hadean Eon is characterized by Earth’s initial formation—from the accretion of dust and gases and the frequent collisions of larger planetesimals<br>
   3_ The name "Hadean" comes from Hades, Greek for "Underworld", due to the conditions on the Earth at the time.<br>
   4_ Earth’s surface was incredibly unstable during the early part of the Hadean Eon.<br>
   5_ Convection currents in the mantle brought molten rock to the surface and caused cooling rock to descend into magmatic seas. <br>
   6_ The Moon is also thought to have formed during the Hadean Eon, and several theories of the Moon’s origin have been posited. <br>
   7_ The leading theory asserts that a collision between Earth and a celestial body the size of Mars ejected material that eventually coalesced into the Moon<br>
   8_ Throughout part of the eon, impacts from extraterrestrial bodies released enormous amounts of heat that likely prevented much of the rock from solidifying at the surface.<br>
   9_ There are no sedimentary rocks from the Hadean at all.<br>
   10_ The earliest geological objects on Earth are some zircons, dated to about 4,400 million years ago<br>
   11_ An explanation for the general lack of Hadean rocks (older than 3800 mya) is the large amount of rocky and icy debris present in the early Solar System<br>
   12_ No life forms are known from this eon. <br>
   13_ The early atmosphere contained carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen, but almost no oxygen.<br>
   14_ Inside the oceans, amino acids from space began to join together into the first proteins, not yet life, but a step along the way.<br>
   15_ Probably the earliest RNA molecules also formed at this time.<br>
