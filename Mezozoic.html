    <h2>15 Interestings facts</h2>
    <p>
   1_ During the Mesozoic, or "Middle Life" Era, life diversified rapidly and giant reptiles, dinosaurs and other monstrous beasts roamed the Earth. <br>
   2_ The period, which spans from about 252 million years ago to about 66 million years ago<br>
   3_ The Permian-Triassic boundary, at the start of the Mesozoic, is defined relative to a particular section of sediment in Meishan, China, where a type of extinct, eel-like creature known as a conodont first appeared<br>
   4_ he end boundary for the Mesozoic Era, the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, is defined by a 20-inch (50 centimeters) thick sliver of rock in El Kef, Tunisia<br>
   5_ The Mesozoic Era began roughly around the time of the end-Permian extinction, which wiped out 96 percent of marine life and 70 percent of all terrestrial species on the planet.<br>
   6_ ife slowly rebounded, eventually giving way to a flourishing diversity of animals, from massive lizards to monstrous dinosaurs.<br>
   7_ he Triassic Period, from 252 million to 200 million years ago, saw the rise of reptiles and the first dinosaurs, the Jurassic Period, from about 200 million to 145 million years ago<br>
   8_ Coniferous plants, or those that have cone-bearing seeds, already existed at the beginning of the era, but they became much more abundant during the Mesozoic. <br>
   9_ Flowering plants emerged during the late Cretaceous Period. <br>
   10_ Earth during the Mesozoic Era was much warmer than today, and the planet had no polar ice caps. <br>
   11_ Without much coastline to moderate the continent's interior temperature, Pangaea experienced major temperature swings <br>
   12_ The Mesozoic Era was bookended by two great extinctions, with another smaller extinction occurring at the end of the Triassic Period<br>
   13_ Because the fossil record is incomplete, it's difficult to say exactly what caused the extinctions, or even how rapidly they occurred. <br>
   14_ Most scientists agree that an asteroid impact wiped out the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous Period.<br>
   15_ The volcanic eruptions caused a spike in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, though the 2014 PNAS study suggests that the spike was brief. <br>
