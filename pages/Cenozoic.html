    <h2>15 Interestings facts</h2>
    <p>
    1_ The Cenozoic Era is the era that we live, and it started 65,5 million years back.<br>
    2_ The beginning of the Cenozoic Era began when the Mesozoic Era ended and dinosaurs became extinct.<br>
    3_ During the Paleocene epoch the world was recovering from the extinction event and mammals were fairly small.<br>It is believed that they were all smaller than 10 kilograms.<br>
    4_ In the Miocene epoch grass spread across the globe and new species evolved.<br>
    5_ The apes in this epoch evolved into 30 new species.<br>
    6_ It is estimated that 95% of the seed plants evolved during this epoch.<br>
    7_ In the Pleistocene epoch ice ages were frequent, and a major extinction event wiped out several species including Neanderthals. Homo sapiens evolved during this epoch.<br>
    8_ The first ancestor of modern humans was the Homo erectus, which existed about 1.6 million years ago.<br>
    9_ The extinction of many species that have occurred since the Industrial Revolution has been caused by humans, not nature or evolution.<br>
    10_ The Paleogene Period is divided into three epochs including the Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligodene epochs.<br>
    11_ Plants were thriving and evolving and evergreen trees began to grow in this period as well.<br>
    12_ In the Holocene epoch, which began 12,000 years ago, man evolved to what we are today. This epoch is also referred to as the 'Age of Man.'<br>
    13_ During the Oligodene epoch mammals began to evolve to include marsupials, dogs, and elephants.
    14_ Early mammals in the Cenozoic Era were quite large. Beavers were as long as 7 feet. Birds were as tall as 7 feet. Sloths grew to the size of our current elephants.<br>
    15_ Cenozoic rocks are extensively developed on all the continents, particularly on lowland plains, as, for example, the Gulf and Atlantic coastal plains of North America. <br>
