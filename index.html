                        The first principle you need to understand about geologic time is that the laws of nature 
                        are always the same. This means that the laws describing how things work are the same today as
                         they were billions of years ago. For example, water freezes at 0°C. This law has always been 
                         true and always will be true. Knowing the natural laws helps you think about Earth's past, 
                         because it gives you clues about how things happened very long ago. It means that we can use 
                         present-day processes to interpret the past. Imagine you find fossils of sea animals in a rock. 
                         The laws of nature say that sea animals must live in the sea. That law has never changed, so the 
                         rock must have formed near the sea. The rock 
                        may be millions of years old, but the fossils in it are a clue for us today about how it formed.

                    By noting the relationships of different rock units, Nicolaus Steno in 1669 described two basic geologic principles. The 
                    first stated that sedimentary rocks are laid down in a horizontal manner, and the second stated that
                     younger rock units were deposited on top of older rock units. To envision this latter principle think
                      of the layers of paint on a wall. The oldest layer was put on first and is at the bottom, while the 
                      newest layer is at the top. An additional concept was introduced by James Hutton in 1795, and later 
                      emphasized by Charles Lyell in the early 1800s.For the next major contribution to the geologic time 
                      scale we turn to William Smith, a surveyor, canal builder, and amateur geologist from England. In 1815 
                      Smith produced a geologic map of England in which he successfully demonstrated the validity of the 
                      principle of faunal succession. This principle simply stated that fossils are found in rocks in a very 
                      definite order. This principle led others that followed to use fossils to define increments within a relative time scale.

                    Two ways, the Relative and Absolute Age Dating. The clues in rocks help scientists put 
                    together a picture of how places on Earth have changed. Scientists noticed in the 1700s
                     and 1800s that similar layers of sedimentary rocks all over the world contain similar 
                     fossils. They used relative dating to order the rock layers from oldest to youngest. 
                     In the process of relative dating, scientists do not determine the exact age of a 
                     fossil but do learn which ones are older or younger than others.However, the early 
                     geologic time scale only showed the order of events. It did not show the actual years 
                     that events happened. With the discovery of radioactivity in the late 1800s, scientists
                      were able to measure the exact age in years of different rocks. Measuring the amounts
                       of radioactive elements in rocks let scientists use absolute dating to give ages to 
                       each chunk of time on the geologic time scale. For example, they are now able to state
                        that the Jurassic began about 200 million years ago and that it lasted for about 
                        55 million years.
